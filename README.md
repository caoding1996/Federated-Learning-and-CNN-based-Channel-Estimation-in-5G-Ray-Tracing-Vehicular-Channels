# Federated-Learning-and-CNN-based-Channel-Estimation-in-5G-Ray-Tracing-Vehicular-Channels
This simple demo has the following functionality
1. Vehicles serves as transmitter and receiver, and their locations is extracted through SUMO and TraCI.
2. Then the locations of transmitter and receiver are imported to MATLAB ray-tracing simulation in real-time.
3. Construct the 5G ray-tracing channel in MATLAB, which also include the LDPC encoding process.
4. MATLAB Output the channel response images continuously to form the training dataset for CNN.
